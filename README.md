# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

My player centeric adaption is that if the player really bad at the game (accumulate 7 or more rows using every 7 teris), the chance they get I shape piece will increase.
Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
