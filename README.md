# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

My thought on implementing this adaptation is that making the droping bricks slow down if the players accumulate certain lines of blocks in a period of time
Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
